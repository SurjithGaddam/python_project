# Overview

Welcome to my exploration of the data job market, with a focus on data analyst roles. This project stems from a desire to better understand and navigate the job market. It examines top-paying and high-demand skills to identify optimal opportunities for data analysts.

The analysis is based on data from Luke Barousse's Python Course, offering a comprehensive foundation with details on job titles, salaries, locations, and key skills. Using Python scripts, I investigate critical questions, including the most sought-after skills, salary trends, and the balance between demand and compensation in data analytics.

# The Questions
Below are the questions I want to answer in my project:

What are the skills most in demand for the top 3 most popular data roles?
How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?
How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?
What are the optimal skills for data analysts to learn? (High Demand AND High Paying)
Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

##### Python: 
The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to analyze the data and find critical insights.I also used the following Python libraries:
##### Pandas Library:
 This was used to analyze the data.
##### Matplotlib Library:
 I visualized the data.
##### Seaborn Library: 
Helped me create more advanced visuals.
##### Jupyter Notebooks: 
The tool I used to run my Python scripts which let me easily include my notes and analysis.
##### Visual Studio Code:
 My go-to for executing my Python scripts.
##### Git & GitHub: 
Essential for version control and sharing my Python code and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.
# Data Preparation and Cleanup
This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.

# Import & Clean Up Data
I start by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset, followed by initial data cleaning tasks to ensure data quality.

# Importing Libraries
import ast
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from datasets import load_dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  

# Loading Data
dataset = load_dataset('lukebarousse/data_jobs')
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()

# Data Cleanup
df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notna(x) else x)
Filter US Jobs
To focus my analysis on the U.S. job market, I apply filters to the dataset, narrowing down to roles based in the United States.

df_US = df[df['job_country'] == 'United States']
# The Analysis
## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the the top 3 most popular data roles?

To find the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles. I filtered out those positions by which ones were the most popular, and got the top 5 skills for these top 3 roles. This query highlights the most popular job titles and their top skills, showing whihch skills I should pay attention to depending on the role I'm targeting.

   ###  Insights 
   The chart provides insights into the likelihood of specific skills being requested for three key data roles in U.S. job postings: Data Analyst, Data Engineer, and Data Scientist. Here are some key takeaways:
   Data Analyst:
Top Skills:
SQL (51%) is the most in-demand skill for Data Analysts, highlighting its importance in querying and managing databases.
Excel (41%) is highly relevant for tasks like data cleaning, reporting, and analysis.
2. Data Engineer:
Top Skills:
SQL (68%) and Python (65%) dominate, showcasing their central role in data extraction, transformation, and pipeline development.
Cloud and Big Data Tools:
AWS (43%) is frequently mentioned, emphasizing the importance of cloud computing.
3. Data Scientist:
Top Skills:
Python (72%) is overwhelmingly the most requested skill, reflecting its dominance in machine learning and data analysis.
SQL (51%) and R (44%) are also important for data manipulation and statistical analysis.
Visualization and Statistical Tools:
SAS and Tableau (both 24%) are less commonly requested, suggesting their more niche applications.

General Observations:
SQL and Python are critical across all three roles, with higher demand for SQL in engineering and analytical roles and Python dominating in data science.
Cloud and big data tools (e.g., AWS, Azure, Spark) are more relevant to Data Engineers.
Visualization tools like Tableau are more prominent for Data Analysts, while Data Scientists emphasize programming and statistical skills.

## 2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?
To find how skills are trending in 2023 for Data Analysts, I filtered data analyst positions and grouped the skills by the month of the job postings. This got me the top 5 skills of data analysts by month, showing how popular skills were throughout 2023.

# 3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysis?
To identify the highest-paying roles and skills, I only got jobs in the United States and looked at their median salary. But first I looked at the salary distributions of common data jobs like Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Data Analyst, to get an idea of which jobs are paid the most.

View my notebook with detailed steps here:
[4_salary_analysis](3_project\4_salary_analysis.ipynb)

''' python 
sns.boxplot(data=df_US_top6, x='salary_year_avg', y='job_title_short', order=job_order, color='brown')
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')

plt.title('Salary Distributions in the United States')
plt.xlabel('Yearly Salary (USD)')
plt.ylabel('')
plt.xlim(0, 600000)
ticks_X = plt.FuncFormatter(lambda y, pos: f'${int(y/100)}k')
plt.gca().xaxis.set_major_formatter(ticks_X)
plt.show()
''''
## Results
